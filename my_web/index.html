    <h1>Spider Lily</h1>
    <script src="js /script.js"></script>
    Spider Lily depicts a spider-like creature that is in constant random motion. There is a small bee that flies around the canvas and follows the mouse cursor. When the mouse is pressed, the bee "makes a sudden noise," which startles the spider, triggering its transformation into its flower form - the spider lily.
